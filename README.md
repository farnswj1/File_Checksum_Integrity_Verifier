# File Checksum Integrity Verifier (FCIV)
This is a simple GUI that allows the user to get the checksum of a file. The user can also specify which hash function to use.

NOTE: Not all hash functions are included in this program. This is largely because some functions are no longer supported. Also, some functions, notable the SHAKE series, require additional arguments. For simplicity and convenience, those algorithms are not included.
